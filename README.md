# roguelikedevbasic

This is a work in progress intended to provide a basis for roguelikes that can go several directions and inevitably split off into several different roguelikes.

Thanks to many folks but especially to libtcod maintainers ("Jice and the libtcod contributors"), HexDecimal (current maintainer), and TStand90 for his tutorials.

Currently implemented, in a hopefully growing list:

* Walking
* Very basic message console
* Very basic menu
* Change font
* Change controls (alt-"numpad" scheme and vi-keys supported. All control schemes incorporate arrow keys.)

Feature requests welcome.
