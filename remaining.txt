* Get other two trap types into place:
. X Flings you backwards
. X Rolling boulder
. X Needs "boulder" entity
* Gold that can be collected
* Expand game to 3 levels long
- "Stairs" entity that can be entered and causes new level generation
- Corruption of map as game goes on (for starters, switch the glyphs up starting at level 2)
* Game generates win condition
- Artifact on level 3 which collection thereof means "game is won"
* Status console showing:
X "Legend" of trap glyphs on map and what they're (supposed to) mean
X Amount of gold collected
- Maybe just put basic help info here? IDK. It's a lot of empty space.
* Stretch goals:
- Fake walls that can "crumble" or slide revealing new map area
- Expand messages to entire bottom row instead of just map_width
- Alternately, expand level gen to where messages area and roll messages into the status bar area. (thoughts welcome here)
- Prologue
- Epilogue
- Title screen
* Fake Wall-crumble E-W
* Fake Wall-crumble N-S
* Title screen splash (I don't have a great tool for this, but if you fire up MegaZeux and make a quick Ascii logo with characters 176,177,178 and 20...9? whatever the solid block one is) I can probably convert it to something I can actually display on a title screen)
